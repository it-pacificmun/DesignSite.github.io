                                    Currently a Gr. 11 student attending Semiahmoo Secondary, Judith is absolutely ecstatic to be serving as the USG of Conference for this year’s PacificMUN.
                                    Ever since her first Model UN conference in Gr. 9, Judith has cultivated a sincere passion for Model UN and its community.
                                    She believes that Model UN is an educational experience unlike any other, and is an excellent outlet to develop public speaking skills, expand international knowledge, and connect with amazing individuals.

                                    Outside the exciting world of Model UN, Judith is also heavily invested in her school community, event organization, and social justice.
                                    In her spare time however, Judith can be found watching documentaries, editing her Spotify playlists, and playing volleyball.
                                    All in all, Judith hopes to provide a memorable delegate experience and looks forward to PacificMUN 2018!
