                                    Ever since her first Model UN conference in Gr. 9, Judith has cultivated a sincere passion for Model UN and its community.
                                    She believes that Model UN is an educational experience unlike any other, and is an excellent outlet to develop public speaking skills, expand international knowledge, and connect with amazing individuals.

                                    Outside the exciting world of Model UN, Judith is also heavily invested in her school community, event organization, and social justice.
                                    In her spare time however, Judith can be found watching documentaries, editing her Spotify playlists, and playing volleyball.
                                    All in all, Judith hopes to provide a memorable delegate experience and looks forward to PacificMUN 2018!

                  PacificMUN is pleased to offer sixteen unique committees that embody controversy and diplomacy.
                  Our innovative committees are suitable for a wide range of delegates:
                  beginner delegates may enjoy the diverse perspectives of a General Assembly, while veteran delegates may participate in exhilarating, intense debate within a smaller sphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                  Positions papers are due (date).
                  It is highly recommended for delegates to submit a position paper in order to be considered for an award.
                  Delegates in advanced and crisis committees must submit a position paper, with exceptions to Ad Hoc.
            </p>
            <p>
                  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Xudi Lin, our USG Committees 1, via committees1@pacificmun.org,
                  or Adam Mawji, our USG Committees 2, via committees2@pacificmun.org.
